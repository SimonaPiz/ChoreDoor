## General Information

In this project, I created the entire logic to make the game work.

### Features:

- [x]  When the page loads the doors are closed and the hidden images are randomly matched.
- [x]  when the user clicks on a door, it opens showing the image
    - [x]  if the image is the ChoreBot, the user loses
    - [x]  otherwise the user can go ahead and click on another door
    - [x]  if the user manages to avoid the ChoreBot until the last door, he wins
- [x]  the label at the bottom shows the state of the game (win or loss)
- [x]  The button resets the game when clicked
